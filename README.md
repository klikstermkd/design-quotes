# design-quotes

Sample React app to demonstrate fetching data from Firebase using redux-saga.

**Demo**: https://design-quotes.firebaseapp.com

To run the app locally follow these intructions:

1. Install all required node modules with ```npm install```
2. Start the server with ```npm run serve```
3. Open up the browser and go to ```http://localhost:8080```

If you want to play around with the code:

1. Assuming you have already installed all node modules, first build the app with Webpack and watch for changes by running ```npm run dev:build```
2. Open up another terminal window and run ```npm run dev:serve```
3. And finally open up the browser and go to ```http://localhost:8080```
